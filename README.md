# Project Repository for JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification
This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" course on FreeCodeCamp.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my proficiency in using JavaScript to solve various algorithmic problems and implementing data structures. The projects in this repository demonstrate my understanding of various concepts such as loops, conditional statements, functions, recursion, arrays, objects, classes, and more.

## Projects
The repository contains the following four projects:

### Palindrome Checker:
A program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.
### Roman Numeral Converter:
A program that converts a given number into a Roman numeral.
### Caesars Cipher:
A program that performs a Caesar cipher on a given string by shifting the letters by a certain number of spaces.
### Telephone Number Validator: 
A program that validates whether a given string is a valid US phone number.
Each project is contained in its own directory, which includes the source code and a README file with instructions on how to run the program.

## Technologies Used
The projects in this repository were implemented using JavaScript.

## Getting Started
To run any of the projects in this repository, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Simply navigate to the directory of the project you want to run in your terminal, and type to start the program by running the following command:
```bash
node app.js
```

## Conclusion
Completing these projects has helped me to solidify my understanding of JavaScript algorithms and data structures. I am excited to continue learning and building upon the skills I have developed through this course.
